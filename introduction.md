<p>First, let’s create a new project and call it <strong>SEIntro</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Visual Studio 2019</strong></li>
<li>Select menu <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Project</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Installed &gt; Visual C# &gt; Space Engineers &gt; Ingame Script</strong></li>
<li>Give it name <strong>SEIntro</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> and then <strong>Create New Project</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are two types of comments in C# – single-line and multi-line.<br>
Single-line comments are created using double slash.</p>
<pre class=" language-csharp"><code class="prism  language-csharp"><span class="token comment">// This is a single-line comment</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Multi-line comments start with <strong>/**</strong> and end with <strong>**/</strong></p>
<pre class=" language-csharp"><code class="prism  language-csharp"><span class="token comment">/**
 * This is a multi-line comment
 **/</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Below is the contents of the <strong>Program.cs</strong> file that you’re presented with in a new project. In this example I left comments that are generated automatically with a new project as single-line comments, and also added multi-line comments to explain some other things.</p>
